# MNIST-Handwritten
This repository contains the implementation of Logistic Regression Classifier and also a model using Neural Networks.

All the models needed are made from scratch.
The data for training has been taken by the Coursera Machine Learning course hosted by Stanford University.
The program for optimizing a function (fmincg) is not originally made by me.
